            the chaos that is men. Men desired peace yet waged a war for it, only for that war to bring further chaos.

        <h2 class="right"><br>On the battlefield, he slayed numerous enemies. Enemies with sword for a heart, bow for a mind, and hammer for a will.
            Tough battles sharpened him. Fueling him with even more desire for glory. He hated killing, but loved the honor that came with it.

        <h2 class="left"><br>In the end, there was a huge difference between a battle and a war. One could win hundred battles, but losing the war meant the end. The moment he saw hundreds of enemies charging towards him, he knew he lost the war.
            But, as long as he lived by the sword, he was prepared to die by the sword. He runs towards the charge as he whispers to himself, "Legends never die". Even when his death loomed in front of him, the fire in his eyes did not waver at all.

            the winds of the great plain travels above the grave of the dead warriors, and whispers the tale for eternity.
